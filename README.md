# Bikeshare-Data-Analysis
In this python data analysis project, 
you can ask questions about Bikeshare Data and get answers. Like what is the most common trip? most common week day of travel? Also the distance traveled and things like most common year of birth for users!

Caution: You need to unzip .CSV files before exploring the code. Thank you!
